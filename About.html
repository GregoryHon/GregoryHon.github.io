            <h1>About</h1> 
            <h2>My name is Gregory Hon.  I am a Senior at the University of Florida majoring in Telecommunications.  As a child, I grew up around sports and still have love and enthusiasm for all types of sports. </h2>
            <p>I was born in Washington D.C. in 1990.  Four short years later both of my parents got job at the University of Florida and I have been a Gator ever since.  Although my father was new to the town, my mother grew up in Gainesville like I did and my uncle received his masters degree at the Florida business school.  Before my grandfather retired, he worked in the College of Journalism and Communications at Florida.  So being a Gator has been part of my heritage - yes, I do bleed orange and blue.</p>
            <p>I have been playing sports for all of my life.  When I was only four years old my dad started me up with tennis which is his favorite sport.  I still play it today with fellow members of the UF Tennis Club.  Although I love all sports, tennis is the only one I played seriously in high school.  That being said I would have to say that basketball is my favorite sport, with soccer at a really close second.  Over the past summer I helped my intramural basketball team make it to the final four of the playoffs.  </p>
            <p>After I graduate, I plan to go to business school (hopefully at UF).  As a child growing up in Gainesville, during the summer, I would go to camp and a place called DB Racquet Club.  Some of my best memories were formed while being there and I hope to one day own a business that runs itself in similar fashion to DB.  I want to own a facility that resembles a sporting paradise where I can host tournaments, aquire members, host childrens camps, and offer personal lessons.  My facility will be a place where people can come and forget about there worries and get lost in a land of athletic entertainment.</p>
